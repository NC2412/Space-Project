# Space-Project
Space related project I'll work on continuously. This project will have multiple aspects to it. As of right now I plan to implement an orbital predictions calculator and various rocket calculations, such as specific impulse based on fuel types, etc.

This project will use python plotting libraries with c++ DLLs to provide a visualizatin for orbits around certain bodies.
